# Affinity Card Approval Prediction: Logistic Regression Model for Customer Insights

## Project Description
This project involves developing a logistic regression machine learning model to predict the likelihood of customers being approved for an affinity card based on their demographic and purchasing data. The model provides insights into customer behavior and helps streamline the decision-making process for affinity card approvals.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared the raw dataset for analysis, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Generated metadata, histograms, and summary statistics to understand data distributions and relationships.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Identified the most influential variables affecting affinity card approvals.
- **Model Development:** Built and tested a logistic regression model for predicting customer eligibility.
- **Random Sampling:** Evaluated the model using a random sample of 1000 records from the dataset.
- **Prediction Application:** Developed an interactive application to predict customer eligibility based on user input or uploaded datasets.
- **Performance Metrics:** Measured model accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix to assess its effectiveness.

## Workflow
1. **Loading and Understanding the Dataset:**
   - Data was loaded, and metadata was generated for better understanding.
   - Key preprocessing steps included removing irrelevant columns, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Data Exploration:**
   - Generated histograms and bar charts for visualizing variable distributions.
   - Analyzed relationships between features and the target variable (Affinity Card approval).

3. **Model Development:**
   - Built a logistic regression model to predict affinity card approvals.
   - Trained and tested the model on an 80-20 split of the dataset.

4. **Prediction Application:**
   - Created an interactive tool to predict customer eligibility based on input features or an uploaded dataset.
   - Designed the app to provide probabilities for each class (approval or rejection).

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Assessed model performance with metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
   - Verified the applicationâ€™s functionality on random samples and unseen data.
